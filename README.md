# Introduction to Docker (for Data Scientists)

This repository contains notebooks and code for my talk at the PyData Chicago Meetup on November 7, 2016.

This talk

  * introduces software containers and why they are useful to data scientists
  * takes a look at the parts of the linux kernel that make software containers possible
  * introduces Docker as a platform for using software containers
  * shows an example of running dask distributed in separate containers on a single host

Run these notebooks in a container:

```shell
docker run -d \
           -p 8888:8888 \ 
           -v ./notebooks:/notebooks \
           -w /notebooks \
           jseabold/dask-jupyter \
           bash -c "jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip='*'"
```

The images are built from my [dockerfiles repo](https://github.com/jseabold/dockerfiles).
